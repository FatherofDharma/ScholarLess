# _ScholarLess_

The independent capstone project for the coding school, Epicodus, written on on September 20th.

#### By **_Daniel Hongel_**

## Summary

This application will use api calls to search for and access open-source versions of research articles, then store them in project directories, to more smoothly handle your own research interests and resources.

## Project Proposal and More Description

#### Initial project Proposal:

> **Project’s Purpose or Goal:**
>
> Allow users to search for and store research articles, especially ones that are often behind paywalls or membership-only walls. The app will allow organization of these articles into personalized folders, that the user can organize. Eventually, I plan to make this into a mobile application as well.
>
> **List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**
>
> - Create, edit, and remove accounts
> - Create, edit and remove project directories for articles
> - Search, return, and store articles
>
> **What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**
>
> - HTML5, JavaScript, Node, Webpack, and associated packages
> - React, most likely Redux, Firebase, and React-Router
> - Depending on project needs, a secondary API may need to be built in Ruby and Rails
>
> **If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**
>
> - Mobile App port
> - More specific layout customizability for users.
> - Suggested articles by the same research group
> - Suggested articles of the same subject matter
>
> **What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**
>
> - Possibly Bootstrap, and jQuery
> - It is possible that I may need to use PostgresQL
> - Possibly other packages for needs that may arise after starting to create the project
>
> **Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?**
>
> I am still determining the viability of using this API but believe it is going to work for my needs. It’s possible that I will have to change this idea, but I will know that pretty soon. I have partly struggling to have enough time to do all of my school-critical and life-critical stuff and have enough time. I have some scheduled time to answer this question in the next few days.

#### Description:

Work log for project submission requirements:

Friday, September 20th:

1. Started off with brainstorming and considering project structure, with no code or documents to submit.
2. Create basic project structure
3. Readme creation
4. Researching core api at https://core.ac.uk/services/api/
5. Working with Core's discovery browser plugin to understand the limitations of their access to research articles.
6. Registered and received a CORE API key and have been navigating documentation and successfully making api calls.
7. Still making API calls and planning the best way to achieve MVP with the current JSON data that is returned.
8. Sketching out various layout ideas and attempting to come up with a solid idea for project component structure.

Friday, September 27th:

1. Started off with some planning and research into various storage solutions.
2. Installed the expo cli as well as app on ios and started the tutorial:
3. Completed 'Getting Started' and 'Learn the Basics' lessons.
4. Completed 'Props' lesson.
5. Completed 'State' lesson.
6. Completed 'Style' lesson.
7. Completed 'Height and Width' lesson.
8. Completed 'Layout with Flexbox' lesson.
9. Completed 'Handling Text Input' lesson.
10. Completed 'Handling Touches' lesson.
